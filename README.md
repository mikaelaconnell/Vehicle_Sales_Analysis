# Phase4_Project
Predicting Car Price Using Machine Learning Models

Executive Summary: Vehicle Sales Data Analysis

Objective: The goal of this project was to analyze vehicle sales data to identify key factors influencing selling price and gain insights into trends in the used car market. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical techniques, and machine learning models, we examined the relationships between vehicle attributes and their prices.

Predictive Modeling Performance
Three machine learning models were tested to predict vehicle selling prices:

Linear Regression: R² = 0.9679, MAE = $1,082

Random Forest: R² = 0.9706, MAE = $1,056

XGBoost: R² = 0.9670, MAE = $1,037

Random Forest and XGBoost performed slightly better than Linear Regression, reducing prediction errors. However, XGBoost had marginally higher interpretability and efficiency in handling complex relationships.

Conclusion & Business Impact:
This analysis provides actionable insights for dealerships and individual sellers to price vehicles more effectively. By understanding key factors influencing price, sellers can make data-driven decisions to optimize profitability. Future work can explore time-series forecasting and expand feature engineering for improved accuracy.
